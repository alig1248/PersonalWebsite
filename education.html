    <p>I graduated from El Paso's Coronado High School as part of the class of 2021. During my time in high school, I was part of the school's Key Club where I participated in volunteer and donation projects for several years. Beginning in early 2020, I was one of the Social Media Communication and Design leads for the local El Paso chapter of March for our Lives. In my role, I collaborated with my peers/colleagues to produce social media content surrounding March for our Lives' message. This included writing text and designing appealing social media posts. I was part of the National Honor Society and completed high school with an International Baccalaureate (IB) Program Diploma. I graduated within the top 10% of Coronado High School's class of 2021.</p>

		<p>I am currently attending the University of New Mexico -- I am (at the present moment) pursuing a Film and Digital Arts Degree. I have been placed on the Dean's List for my last and only two semesters: Fall of 2022 and Spring of 2023. Though I am currently attending the University of New Mexico, I joined the Phi Eta Sigma Honor Society during my first year at the university. I am excited to continue my academic career and am currently enjoying taking many different courses to further explore my likes.</p></div>
