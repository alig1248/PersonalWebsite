    <p>Welcome to the About page, where I will share a bit about me! </p>
		  <div class="h2"> Who Am I? </div></div>
	  <div class="body">
    <p>My full name is Ava Joan Ligorio and I am from the "Sun City" -- El Paso, Texas. I do enjoy the Southwest -- despite its dryness and heat! I am currently twenty years old. I love movies and music. I listen to music most hours of the day -- I believe it is what keeps the world revolving! I have one sister named Francesca and four cat siblings: Sloane, Thomas, Felix, and Earl. </p>
		  <p>In terms of professional goals, I am unsure of the future at the moment. I do hope to be successful and comfortable in the future -- and, most importantly -- doing something that I enjoy. I do know what is important to me now: my loved ones and spending as much time as I can living in each present moment. That is something I struggle with -- being present. I am oftentimes preoccupied by the past or the future -- I think we all should focus on the very important now. </p></div>
	  <div class="h2"> My Life's Love </div></div>
	  <div class="body">
		  <p>In the absence of a love of love today, my greatest dream is to make life a little bit easier for all of us. I think we are all wondrous creatures with a lot to offer each other. Life is a profound experience. It is difficult! To quote the great Stevie Wonder: "Love's in need of love today." Then, to quote the great Joni Mitchell: "We are stardust / we are golden!" We are the smallest of particles, and we are also sparkly because of that!</p></div>
