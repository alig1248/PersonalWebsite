    <p>Hello and welcome to my personal website! </p>
    <p>My name is Ava Ligorio and in entering this website you will learn a bit about me and see some of my work. This website includes home, about, education, portfolio, and contact web pages and is an exploration of what I have learned in web design and my personal work and style. In order to make a pleasing and cohesive website, I have used an Art Nouveau and Art Deco-style theme. I am excited to share it with you. If you interested in knowing more about me, please visit the "About" page, where I detail who I am. If you would like to read about my academic history, please go to the "Education" page. If some of my work is what you seek, the "Portfolio" page displays some work. Most importantly, if you would like to get in touch with me, visit the "Contact" page where you send a direct email to me!</p>

	   <div class="body">
<p>I feel the most happy when I am surrounded by the things that I love. My goal for this personal site is to reflect a bit about the things that I love -- and advocate for myself through offering some of my work for you to see. I hope to continue updating the site as my work improves and I gain more love to share with you. But for now:</p>
	  <p>Thank you for visiting -- and I hope you enjoy exploring this website!</p></div>
