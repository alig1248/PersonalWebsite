		  <p>This is my currently-running blog! It is titled "Ruminations" and it is an opinion blog (hence the thoughts/ruminations!) that is centered around music, movies, and fashion. This blog was created with the goal of simply appreciating the world around us -- and the art that fills it. If you feel the same way, please visit the Wordpress site! It is my way of capturing and elucidating the emotions that I feel when I interact with the art that I enjoy. It is a celebration of all things art -- and has also been a way for me to improve my design skills when it comes to website building. I hope you enjoy!</p>

		   <p>This short video was made in a film class. Using everyday equipment, I sought to highlight the sacred space of the dining room table and the family dinners that take place around and on it. It is a celebration of music and food and is a short capture of my family and my life. I hope that many can see themselves in this video. This is my experience -- but I made this film hoping that everyone can connect with it when thinking of their own experiences. The film is titled "The Angel Watched Over Us When We Eat." It was made during the winter of 2022.</p></div>

		   <p>This video was made using Apple's Video Editing software iMovie. In this video, I have practiced inserting multiple images and writing dialogue that almost serves as an advertisement for the Plaza Classic Film Festival in El Paso, Texas. I sourced images from the web to fit the narration I included. I do have other videos that I have edited, and I hope to include them soon. This video was made during the winter of 2023.</p></div>
